This is an Arduino on a breadboard.  I don't claim any originality here, this is
all copied from various sources on the internet.

The chip is an ATmega328.  The breakout board is a thermocouple sensor.

My ISP cable looks like this, from above, with the connector facing down plugged
into the board.

|GND    MOSI +5V  |

The serial on this board isn't on the standard pins for some reason, I put it on
18 and 19.  I don't remember why.

The serial header is:

+-------------------------+
| +5V GND boardRX boardTX |
+-------------------------+

pins for prolific USB cable are:

black  = ground
red    = power
white  = RX (into usb cable)
green  = TX (from usb cable)

so plugged into the board, thats: red, black green white

That's if they're all plugged in.  It's probably not a good idea to plug in the
+5V from the prolific cable if the ISP header is also plugged in.
