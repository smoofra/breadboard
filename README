This is an Arduino on a breadboard.  I don't claim any originality here, this is
all copied from various sources on the internet.  Eventually this will be a
temperature control board for a hot plate.

The chip is an ATmega328.  The breakout board is a thermocouple sensor.

My ISP cable looks like this, from above, with the connector facing down plugged
into the board.  (on an Arduino UNO the bottom part is towards the outside of
the board).

The serial header is two pins on the upper left hand side of the chip. (Theres
another two pin header for power nearby).

pins for prolific USB cable are:

black  = ground
red    = power
white  = RX (into usb cable)
green  = TX (from usb cable)

So plugged into the board, thats: white, green.  It should be obvious enough
where the red and black go.  The board can be powerd by the red +5V pin from the
prolific cable, but it's probably not a good idea to plug in the +5V from the
prolific cable if the ISP header is also plugged in.

Front panel is black, white green.

Front panel ICSP cable has GND on the upper right.

On the other side of the board there's an I2C header:

+-----------------+
| +5V GND SDA SCL |
+-----------------+

This is for the OLED display.  With the cable I've got wired to the display,
that's: red, brown, orange, yellow.
